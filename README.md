# r2kit

The code previously found in this repository has been properly re-designed and packaged. As such,
this repository is no longer maintained. You can check the "old" branch to see the last state;
however, due to changes in the r2pipe API, most of the code in the "old" branch is not functional.

If you are looking for the utilities to include in your own project or script, they are now packaged
within [r2pyutils](https://github.com/cmatthewbrooks/r2pyutils). (funclist and funcstrings are
included as utility scripts).

If you are looking for the signatures (from my r2con 2018 talk), this functionality is being split
into a separate repository called [r2sigs](https://github.com/cmatthewbrooks/r2sigs).

If you are looking for the functoyara script, I'll make a better version of that available after the
r2sigs work is complete. If you actually read this and want it sooner, message me and I can quickly
whip up a gist.
