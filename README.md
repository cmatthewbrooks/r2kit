# r2kit

## Overview

r2kit is a set of scripts to help with a workflow for malware code analysis using radare.

* sessionstarter.py - Run from inside an r2 session to auto rename imports, thunks, wrapper functions, and library functions.
* funclist.py - Run from inside an r2 session or externally against a binary to list certain function types.
* functoyara.py - Run from inside an r2 session to create a YARA signature for the bytes of the current function.
* funcstrings.py - Run from inside an r2 session to see all referenced strings organized by function.

See [the workflow document](docs/WORKFLOW.md) for more information on usage.

There is also a sigs.py file used to generate signature hashes or match signature hashes during a session. Read the [signatures](docs/SIGNATURES.md) document for more information on the usage and the [library info](docs/LIBINFO.md) document for more information on library code in general.
